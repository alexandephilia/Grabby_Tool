Add build artifacts and Skills system for git-based installs

Major Changes:
- Built TypeScript to dist/ folder for git-based npm installs
- Updated README.md with complete architecture documentation
- Created comprehensive INSTALL.md guide
- Added .gitignore (excludes node_modules, preserves dist/ and Skills/)

Build System:
- Added build script and TypeScript devDependencies to package.json
- Fixed tsconfig.json to handle peer dependencies properly
- Removed peer dependency type re-exports from index.ts
- Made Vite adapter types self-contained

Skills System (980KB AI Knowledge):
- AGENTS.md: AI operational framework
- skills/jotai/: 52 files of state management docs
- skills/frontend-design/: Design patterns and React rules
- skills/motion-dev/: Motion animation library docs
- skills/tailwind-css/: CSS framework reference
- skills/codebase-context/: Project analysis tools
- workflows/: 9 executable bash scripts for AI automation

Installation:
Users can now install via:
  npm install -g git+https://github.com/alexandephilia/Grabby_Tool.git
  grabby init

This copies the entire Skills/ knowledge base to their project,
enabling AI-powered workflows for accessibility audits, component
extraction, style refactoring, and design transformation.
