# 🎯 Grabby: High-Performance AI Developer Infrastructure

**Elevate your workflow.** Grabby is a precision-engineered integration layer designed to bridge the gap between complex UI environments and AI-assisted development. It provides the essential "Eyes" and "Brain" required for autonomous code generation and structural refactoring.

## ⚛️ The Ecosystem

Grabby operates as a dual-core technical framework, modularizing the interaction between the browser and the terminal:

1.  **The Context Inspector (Eyes)**: A high-precision element picker integrated directly into your development environment (Vite, Next.js). It captures component metadata and local state, feeding it directly into the AI context—eliminating manual effort and information loss.
2.  **The Workflow Core (Brain)**: A local knowledge base for advanced project intelligence. Leveraging `mgrep` for semantic search and `comby` for structural transformations, it enables a deterministic approach to complex code modifications.

## ⚡️ Quick Start: Project Integration

Install and configure Grabby in any supported project with a single command:

```bash
npx @grabby/cli init
```

**Automated Setup Includes:**

- **Dependency Management**: Verification and installation of `mgrep` and `comby`.
- **Knowledge Base Scaffolding**: Local deployment of the `Skills/` directory for project-specific context.
- **Protocol Injection**: Automatic configuration of Vite/Next.js adapters for inspector support.
- **Semantic Initialization**: Automated indexing of your codebase for immediate intelligence.

## 🧠 Workflows & Automation

Grabby enables a suite of automated workflows designed to accelerate development and ensure code quality:

| Command                                        | Capability                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bash Skills/workflows/accessibility-audit.sh` | **Accessibility Enforcement**: Specialized WCAG compliance auditing and remediation. |
| `bash Skills/workflows/style-refactor.sh`      | **Style Optimization**: Conversion of legacy or inline styles to utility-first CSS.  |
| `bash Skills/workflows/element-redesign.sh`    | **Design Transformation**: AI-driven UI/UX enhancements and stylistic refreshes.     |
| `bash Skills/workflows/component-extract.sh`   | **Structural Refactoring**: Intelligent modularization of complex UI sections.       |

## 🚀 Operations

1.  **Initialize**: Execute the `npx @grabby/cli init` command.
2.  **Activate**: Launch your local development server.
3.  **Inspect**: Append `?grab=true` to your local URL and select any UI element.
4.  **Execute**: Prompt the AI to process the captured `.grabbed_element` context.
