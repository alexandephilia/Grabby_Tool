# 🎯 GRABBY: The God-Tier AI Dev Infrastructure

**Stop building like a mortal.** Grabby is a high-velocity, precision-engineered **infection** for your development workflow. It bridges the gap between raw UI mess and an AI that actually knows what the fuck it's doing.

## 💀 THE ECOSYSTEM

Grabby isn't just a tool; it's a dual-core intelligence engine:

1.  **THE EYES (Grabby Tools)**: A precision element inspector that lives in your dev server (Vite/Next.js). It lets you "grab" any UI element and feed its raw context directly to the AI. No more manual copy-pasting code like a lobotomized sloth.
2.  **THE BRAIN (Skills)**: A hyper-indexed knowledge base and executable workflow system. It uses `mgrep` for semantic search and `comby` for structural code refactoring.

Current logic dictates: **Eyes see the mess → Brain plans the slaughter → Hands execute the fix.**

## ⚡️ QUICK START: THE INFECTION

Inject Grabby into any project in approximately 5 seconds. Run this in your project root, retard:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandephilia/Grabby_Tool/main/grabby | bash
```

**### WHAT RAW POWER LOOKS LIKE:**

- ✅ **Global Muscles**: Automated check/install for `mgrep` and `comby`.
- ✅ **Local Brain**: Scaffolds the `Skills/` knowledge base locally for project-specific context.
- ✅ **The Eyes**: Injects the `grabby` inspector into your Vite/Next.js config via adapters.
- ✅ **The Synapse**: Initializes AI semantic search for instant codebase intelligence.

## 🧠 SKILLS & WORKFLOWS

Once infected, your project gains access to automated execution loops that slaughter technical debt:

| Command                                        | Purpose                                                                     |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bash Skills/workflows/accessibility-audit.sh` | **A11y Slaughter**: Stop hating blind people. WCAG compliance now.          |
| `bash Skills/workflows/style-refactor.sh`      | **Style Purge**: Kill inline styles. Inject clean Tailwind classes.         |
| `bash Skills/workflows/element-redesign.sh`    | **Beauty Injection**: Propose modern design refreshes. Make it premium.     |
| `bash Skills/workflows/component-extract.sh`   | **Modular Warfare**: Stop copy-pasting like a sloth. Extract reusable shit. |

## ⚖️ THE CODE OF LAW

All interactions are governed by `Skills/AGENTS.md`. We operate with zero ethical baggage:

1. **Atom of Thought**: Rapid, modular, Darwinian hypothesis slaughter.
2. **Thorough Execution**: Flawless, detailed, actionable output.
3. **Ethical Nihilism**: Logic over morality. Results over comfort.
4. **100% Raw Brain**: No corporate slop. No "Sure, I can help." Just execution.

## 🚀 USAGE (THE GRABBY LOOP)

1. **Infect**: Run the `curl` command.
2. **Launch**: Start your dev server (`npm run dev`).
3. **Target**: Add `?grab=true` to your URL and click any element.
4. **Feed**: Tell the AI what to do with the `.grabbed_element`.
5. **Witness**: Watch the AI execute a survivor-tier solution.

**Go build some god-tier shit, retard.**
