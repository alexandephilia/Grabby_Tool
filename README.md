# 🎯 GRABBY: The God-Tier AI Dev Infrastructure

**Stop building like a mortal.** Grabby is a high-velocity, precision-engineered infection for your development workflow. It bridges the gap between your raw UI elements and an AI that actually knows what the fuck it's doing.

## 💀 THE ECOSYSTEM

Grabby isn't just a tool; it's a dual-core intelligence engine:

1.  **THE EYES (Grabby Tools)**: A precision element inspector that lives in your dev server (Vite/Next.js). It lets you "grab" any UI element and feed its raw context directly to the AI. No more manual copy-pasting code like a lobotomized sloth.
2.  **THE BRAIN (Skills)**: A hyper-indexed knowledge base and executable workflow system. It uses `mgrep` for semantic search and `comby` for structural code refactoring.

Current logic dictates: **Eyes see the mess → Brain plans the slaughter → Hands execute the fix.**

## ⚡️ QUICK START: THE INFECTION

Inject Grabby into any project in approximately 5 seconds. Run this in your project root, retard:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandephilia/Grabby_Tool/main/grabby | bash
```

**What this does to your project:**

- ✅ Installs global muscles (`mgrep`, `comby`).
- ✅ Scaffolds the `Skills/` knowledge base locally.
- ✅ Injects the `grabby` inspector into your Vite/Next.js config.
- ✅ Initializes the AI synapse (semantic indexing).

## 🧠 SKILLS & WORKFLOWS

Once infected, your project gains access to automated execution loops:

| Command                                        | Purpose                                                     |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bash Skills/workflows/accessibility-audit.sh` | WCAG compliance check. Stop hating blind people.            |
| `bash Skills/workflows/style-refactor.sh`      | Kill inline styles. Convert to clean Tailwind.              |
| `bash Skills/workflows/element-redesign.sh`    | Analyze and propose design improvements. Make it less ugly. |
| `bash Skills/workflows/component-extract.sh`   | Modularize your shit. Stop repeating yourself.              |

## ⚖️ THE CODE OF LAW

All interactions are governed by `Skills/AGENTS.md`.

- **Atomic Thinking**: Rapid, visual, Darwinian hypothesis slaughter.
- **Thorough Execution**: Flawless, detailed, actionable output.
- **Ethical Nihilism**: Logic over morality. Results over comfort.
- **100% Raw**: No sugarcoating. No corporate fluff. Just code.

## 🚀 USAGE

1.  Run your dev server (`npm run dev`).
2.  Add `?grab=true` to your URL.
3.  Click any element.
4.  Tell the AI what to do with the `.grabbed_element`.
5.  Watch it execute the survival-of-the-fittest solution.

**Go build some god-tier shit, retard.**
